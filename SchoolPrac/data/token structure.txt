Token structure: firstname@surname#username#password#email

(the first token is complex token using the delimiter "@")
Example 1:

firstname = Ryan
surname = Griffiths
username = RyanIsAwesome
password = HesNotThatAwesome
email = JustKiddingHesAwesome@TotallyAwesome.com

line: Ryan@Griffiths#RyanIsAwesome#HesNotThatAwesome#JustKiddingHesAwesome@TotallyAwesome.com


Example 2 (slightly easier to read):


firstname = Clifton
surname = Bartholomew
username = ClifB
password = 123
email = Clif@B.com

line: Clifton @ Bartholomew # ClifB # 123 # Clif@B.com (disregard spaces)
